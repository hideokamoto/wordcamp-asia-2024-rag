I am also very passionate about helping developers learn and applying to speak checks both of those boxes for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s?

How exciting!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordCamp Asia team has worked tirelessly to create a welcoming event, to ensure both new and experienced contributors have a great time working together to improve WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially for new contributors, we have an Orientation Workshop and <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/contributor-day-human-library/\">Human Library</a> for the first time on any Contributor Day. Even if you are new, we have a lot of things to offer. Don‚Äôt panic, get attended!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We‚Äôll start our registration process from <strong>9:00 AM local time</strong>. Ensure you bring your WordCamp Asia ticket and Contributor Day registration confirmation email.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-base-color has-custom-dark-blue-primary-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-39d0c759122936a5a0b78759b50ce0df\">To be a part of the Contributor Day, you&#8217;ll need WordPress.org account. Please <a href=\"https://login.wordpress.org/register\">create an account</a> if you don&#8217;t have already. Also, having <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">WordPress slack account</a> is added advantage. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Altogether, we have 13 different teams, and every team has plans for the day. They will also be informed during the opening ceremony. But, you might want to prepare for which team you want to join. Read the plans of each team below.¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Accessibility</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Accessibility team welcomes everyone interested in contributing to the Accessibility of WordPress core and resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the time together, they&#8217;ll cover the basics of what the team does, and how to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/get-involved/\">get involved</a> as a contributor to our various working groups, review active tickets at weekly bug scrubs, attend bi-weekly meetings, and get help during office hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re new to Contributor Day, they&#8217;ll cover some basic accessibility education with some examples of poor vs. good accessibility. For attendees with development experience, you are welcome to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/get-involved/tickets-tasks-reports/\">review active tickets</a> or <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/test-for-web-accessibility/\">perform testing for accessibility</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To contribute to this team, they ask that you ( if you haven&#8217;t already):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create a <a href=\"https://login.wordpress.org/register\">WordPress.org</a> account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set up a <a href=\"https://github.com/signup\">GitHub.com</a> account.

During WC Asia, visit the Community Team table to ask questions about organizing WordPress events (meetups, WordCamps, and other events); submit a meetup, WordCamp, or event organizer application; participate in an in-person organizer orientation and/or budget review; or receive training on the role of Community Team Supporter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone is welcome, especially meetup organizers or prospective organizers, and others who want to organize WordPress events in their local community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meetups (with Roc√≠o Valdivia)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Questions related to starting or reactivating a new WordPress Meetup group in your city, participate in an in-person orientation and other Q&amp;A related to WordPress Meetups.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordCamps (with Sam Suresh)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Questions related to organizing WordCamps in your city, planning details, eligibility and other WordCamp questions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other WordPress Events [formerly called ‚ÄòNextGen‚Äô] (with Julia Golomb)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Learn how to host creative event formats, and how to apply and get started.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Community Team Supporters (with Devin Maeztri)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get to know how you can join and contribute to the WordPress Community Team as a Supporter.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also check <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Community team</a> page and know more about the team before joining the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you‚Äôre joining Contributor Day in person in Taipei or following along online via the #contributor-day Slack channel, thank you and welcome!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start with, at a minimum, you‚Äôll need to have the latest stable version of nodejs and npm, which you can find here: <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en\">https://nodejs.org/en</a> (LTS is the one Core and Gutenberg use) and <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\">Git </a>installed locally (for core you can also use SVN).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on whether you‚Äôre planning to work on Core or Gutenberg, there are a few different options:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Core, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop\">clone the repo</a> and follow the instructions <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop?tab=readme-ov-file#local-development\">here</a> to install the included development environment. Docker is a prerequisite for it, so if you pick this option, go ahead and <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/\">install Docker first</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the editor, clone the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\">Gutenberg repo</a> and you can then use the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/env\">wp-env package</a>, which also requires <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/\">Docker</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An alternative to these is <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/2023/05/23/wp-now-launch-a-local-environment-in-seconds/\">wp-now</a>, which is a more lightweight option that requires only node/npm. It‚Äôs based on <a href=\"https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/\">wp-playground</a>. Note that there have been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/435\">issues with Playground on Windows</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those attending in person, we‚Äôll be located in the Code Lounge (South Lounge) on the third floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It‚Äôs also required to create a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a> account if you don‚Äôt already have one, and if you‚Äôre using Git, you‚Äôll also need a <a href=\"http://github.com/\">GitHub.com</a> account.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Documentation Team is responsible for keeping WordPress documentation accurate and up-to-date. During WordCamp Asia Contributors Day, they‚Äôll be reviewing and updating existing content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a developer or a regular WordPress user, you can join the table and contribute to the project!

And they will also coordinate with the other team for this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should have WordPress.org account to get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Patterns</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the Patterns table, attendees can expect a more creative direction on how to make beautifully designed, ready-to-go layouts.&nbsp; Whether you are a seasoned web designer or just starting your journey with Gutenberg, this table is to guide and support you every step of the way.

In today‚Äôs post, we chat with <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/joe-a-simpson-jr/\">Joe A Simpson Jr</a>, the co-founder of BlackPress, is known for his WordCamp contributions and dedication to WordPress accessibility and community growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m traveling to Taipei from the west coast of the United States. I live in a town in the northern part of LA County named Castaic, CA. I manage our WordPress network for the 3rd largest transit agency in the US, Metro Los Angeles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I live in Los Angeles and I&#8217;m drawn to the region by work relationships with colleagues whose parents are from Taiwan, an intern of mine traveled frequently to Taiwan, so it felt natural. I&#8217;m a &#8216;foodie (adventurous eater) and I can&#8217;t be more excited to experience a flagship WordPress event abroad and the foods I&#8217;ve tried variations of here in LA. First time to the Far East as well!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>My presentations are always engaging and interactive &#8211; I encourage sharing and participating to provide takeaways that the audiences carry back to their local events and projects. Accessibility is a common topic but this topic is probably not discussed as often as it should be. My hope is that they&#8217;ll be a paradigm shift about accessibility, but also learn why as a community it should be a foundation of all we do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>During the pandemic and the virtual WordCamp years, I met, worked alongside, and go to know Ahmed Chaion across thousands of miles. I can&#8217;t wait to see him and thank him for being such an incredible contributor and someone I consider a friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A colleague I worked with for 7 years said I should try her favorite, stinky tofu, but will probably enjoy mango rice a bit more! I&#8217;m loading up on food videos and ALWAYS ask friends and colleagues to share their favorite foods with me!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engaging with the WordPress Community in general is always exciting!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Tell us something about yourself that we might not know. Party tricks? Secret hobbies?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m an illustrator/animator and won a state film festival in high school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An accomplished home cook and scratch cook &#8211; great stress reliever and something friends and family appreciate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q.

Ben is the founder and author of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Stratechery</a>, and pioneered the subscription business model for individual writers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About Ben Thompson</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben has been publishing Stratechery on WordPress since 2013. Stratechery is a blog about technology and strategy, and the impact of the Internet on media. That includes blogging: Ben has, from the beginning, been a strong proponent of the idea that not only is blogging not dead but that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/bloggings-bright-future/\">its future is brighter than ever</a>. That belief was undergirded by the possibility of new business models, particularly subscriptions. Ben proved that with Stratechery, one of the first subscription-supported blogs that created the model for the entire industry. Today Stratechery is a multi-million dollar content business, and Ben is an influential voice in Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and Washington D.C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stratechery has, from the beginning, been built on WordPress. WordPress and its ecosystem made it possible for Ben to build a new kind of media company, where he was the only employee. Over the last few years, though, Ben has been working to build what he sees as a missing piece of that ecosystem: software that lets creators truly have a direct connection with their customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Session Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben‚Äôs session will tell the story of Stratechery and the development of creator-centric businesses, and how WordPress made that possible. Ben will also introduce Passport, the WordPress plugin that powers Stratechery, and why it can unlock new use cases and business models for creators of all types.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay Tuned for more information</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We will be delivering more information about our event details and full depth of the schedule.

In today‚Äôs post, we chat with <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/rich-tabor/\">Rich Tabor</a>, a product manager at Automattic who&#8217;s dedicated to enhancing WordPress, aiming to make publishing more user-friendly and centered around human interaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I‚Äôm a multidisciplinary maker, specializing in the intersection of product, design and engineering. Sure, it sounds fancy‚Äîbut I really just like to build nice things. I‚Äôm from Atlanta, Georgia, near the east coast of the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Day to day I‚Äôm in my office navigating the various efforts for the next WordPress releases, pushing to make WordPress more intuitive and empowering as ever. You‚Äôll find me sharing knowledge on my blog, <a href=\"https://rich.blog\">https://rich.blog</a>, and on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/richard_tabor?lang=ja\">X</a>, designing in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/04/getting-started-with-the-figma-wordpress-design-library/\">WordPress Design Figma library</a>, and all around the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\">Gutenberg Github repository</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing knowledge is an important facet of who I am. I want to impart the art of design thinking to others, continuously raising the bar across the board‚Äîperhaps even making our sphere a bit more intuitive place to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We‚Äôll dive into the nuances of good, purposeful design, distilling how to leverage design thinking to create intentional experiences for people. It&#8217;s not just for designers, but thinkers and tinkerers who like to create.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my first WordCamp Asia! I‚Äôm just as excited to visit such a beautiful country, as I am at engaging with the WordPress community in Asia. And I‚Äôm open to trying most foods; just need a few local friends so take me to the best places!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Tell us something about yourself that we might not know. Party tricks? Secret hobbies?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I‚Äôm a decent electric guitar player, playing with a local band here and there. I‚Äôm known as a Monopoly fiend (the board game). My partner would say I‚Äôm an unusually good guesser.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q.

In today‚Äôs post, we chat with <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/hannah-swain-lovik/\">Hannah Swain L√∏vik</a>, senior manager at Automattic responsible for people management within WooCommerce and Happiness Engineering.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to be traveling from Stockholm, Sweden to visit WordCamp Asia!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, I lead teams of Happiness Engineers supporting WooCommerce at Automattic. I spend large chunks of my time talking to people: how are you doing? What&#8217;s working? What&#8217;s not working? Part of that is so that I can support them personally, while some of that is so that I can help them better support our products and our merchants. I work across Automattic Happiness to smooth the way for our Happiness Engineers, for example around communication, expectations, recognition, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still carve out time to focus on my own projects and interests &#8211; I&#8217;m always looking for ways to be more efficient, to better understand and set priorities, and how to balance work and life. That&#8217;s particularly tricky in the Open Source world as it often feels like work and life blend together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to speak at WordCamp Asia to connect with a different part of the community. Pressure to perform is high across the world, but particularly high in Asia &#8211; I hope that my session on moving from <em>FOMO (the fear of missing out) to JOMO (the joy of missing out)</em> plants some seeds that help people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea for this session sparked from a random comment during a conversation. I thought it was neat and wanted to build on it, so fleshed it out and submitted it to WordCamp Asia in September. Now that I&#8217;ve been looking for them, it&#8217;s surprising just how much material there is around the concept of JOMO (the joy of missing out) &#8211; simply being aware that a different approach is possible has helped me find so much inspiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, did you know that if you live to be 80 years old, you will have lived for about 4000 weeks? What will you have done &#8211; or not done? &#8211; with that time?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The people! I have so many amazing people to meet that I haven&#8217;t gotten the opportunity to connect with in person before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am also deeply curious about the food. Iron eggs?! Bring it on! I&#8217;d also love to try a night market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Tell us something about yourself that we might not know. Party tricks? Secret hobbies?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve recently discovered graphic novels &#8211; Saga is amazing, and I can also highly recommend series like Descender.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonus edition: I love hats! I have a whole collection. Which one will I be wearing at WC Asia?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q.

In today‚Äôs post, we chat with <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/mina-tamang/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mina Tamang</a>, SEO analyst at CodeWing Solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Namaste from the land of the Himalayas! I will be joining the event all the way from Nepal, where my days are a whirlwind of SEO strategies and crafting captivating content with my amazing team (we&#8217;re a bunch of energetic bubbles, trust me!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But beyond the spreadsheets and algorithms, there&#8217;s another side to me. You&#8217;ll find me honing my voice at Founders Toastmasters (current VPE, no big deal), always striving to connect and inspire. And in between the hustle, I cherish simple joys, big or small, whether it&#8217;s a shared cup of chai with loved ones or exploring a hidden waterfall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>My local WordCamp team from Nepal and my boss initially encouraged me to apply for the Speaker role at WordCamp Asia. But the moment I attended my first WordCamp event, I knew I wanted to be on a larger stage. The combined efforts of my team and my own burning desire led me to pursue this opportunity as a speaker at WordCamp Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a bit of a storyteller, even when I don&#8217;t try! So, I will be sharing SEO tales, filled with real-life struggles and triumphs. But beyond the stories, I want to bust some myths about SEO that plague many business owners. Let&#8217;s clear the air and reveal what actually works in the ever-evolving digital world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, as a first-time flagship WordCamp Asia attendee, I&#8217;m wide-eyed and ready to soak it all in: the electrifying talks and workshops, the buzzing energy of the community, and everything else this amazing event has to offer! Taipei itself is a mystery waiting to be explored, and I&#8217;m game for anything ‚Äì from local delicacies that&#8217;ll tantalize my taste buds to impromptu adventures with fellow WordCampers. Basically, I&#8217;m here to learn, connect, and maybe even stumble upon a life-changing xiao long bao!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Tell us something about yourself that we might not know. Party tricks? Secret hobbies?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a walking contradiction ‚Äì a shy extrovert, if you can believe it! In unfamiliar settings, I&#8217;m a silent observer, soaking in the atmosphere like a sponge. But put me with the right people, and there&#8217;s a whole other me waiting to unleash! Suddenly, I&#8217;m the life of the party, chatting away until the sun comes up (though at that point, my &#8220;active listening&#8221; skills might take a backseat).</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q.

In today‚Äôs post, we chat with <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/miriam-schwab/\">Miriam Schwab</a> about the juggling act that is being a mom of seven‚Äîwhilst also founding, and selling, two WordPress businesses. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m joining the event from Israel. My day to day is quite busy as a mom. I get up early to do laundry, prepare lunches for the kids, drink my coffee (very important) and go on a morning walk. Then I start my day fresh and energized. The rest of the day flows as necessary, and can include welcome (and unwelcome) surprises, but I like that my days are dynamic. It keeps things interesting. At the end of the day me and the kids plan dinner, eat, maybe hangout and watch something together, and then it&#8217;s bed time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I love WordCamps and speaking at these conferences is such a privilege. I&#8217;m grateful I can share my knowledge and experiences and hope that it&#8217;s helpful to others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to talk about the juggling act that is being a mom of seven while founding, and selling, two WordPress businesses. It&#8217;s a unique perspective, and I think there will be some nuggets in there for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m always excited to meet up with the WordPress community. It&#8217;s exciting, interactive and fun. I&#8217;m very much looking forward to seeing Taipei‚Äîthis is one place I never dreamed I&#8217;d get to visit, and it looks so beautiful! So I&#8217;m very excited to experience this new place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Tell us something about yourself that we might not know. Party tricks? Secret hobbies?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Between being a mom and business woman, I don&#8217;t have time or energy for hobbies. When I do have some downtime, I usually watch a TV show or movie. Not very exciting. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Lightning Round!&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"line-height:1\"><strong>Most-visited website</strong>: Facebook.com. Kind of embarrassing, but true!</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1\"><strong>Most-have gadget</strong>: My cellphone standholder thingy. I have one and it&#8217;s great by my desk or in the kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1\"><strong>Most-read book</strong>: <a href=\"https://theleanstartup.com/\">The Lean Startup</a>, by Eric Ries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1\"><strong>Go-to podcast</strong>: None. I like listening to episodes here and there, but podcasts put me to sleep! Not because the content isn&#8217;t interesting, but the sound of people talking does that to me. So I&#8217;m all about my Apple Music library.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Find out more about Miriam&#8217;s appearance at WordCamp Asia 2024 <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/miriam-schwab/\">here</a>.</p>\n",

In today‚Äôs post, we chat with <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/ricky-blacker/\">Ricky Blacker</a>, a self taught web professional, co-organizer for the Brisbane and Sunshine Coast WordPress Meetup groups in Australia, and serial hobbyist. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p> I live in Brisbane Australia and work for WP Engine as a Senior Partner Enablement Manager. My main role is to help agencies and brands understand how to use our platform from a technology standpoint. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am also a musician and play keyboards and guitar in a rock band called the TommyCatz. I am a serial hobbyist, my wife says I have way too many hobbies, and she is probably right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I am always excited to be involved with WordCamps across the globe, whether it is helping organise, volunteering or speaking, but this time I had an important message I needed to share with the WordPress community and being able to do that at WordCamp Asia would allow me to do that to a very large audience with the rest of the world eagerly looking on, so it made sense to apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In my talk I hope to build awareness of how important it is to implement accessibility into every website, this not only helps those with disabilities to be able to access the content on the web, but it also has many benefits beyond this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?¬†</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I am totally looking forward to sampling some of the culinary delights from Taipei, especially want to try the Scallion and Daikon Pancake, also can&#8217;t wait to catch up with some of my WordPress friends that I only get to see at WordCamps as well as making some new friends along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Tell us something about yourself that we might not know. Party tricks? Secret hobbies?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I have soooo many hobbies, and I wish they were secret enough my wife did not find out as she says I have way too many, like flying remote control planes and drones, playing computer games, riding motorcycles, music recording and production, BBQing and smoking meats and just recently 3D printing</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Lightning Round!¬†</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"line-height:1\"><strong>Most-visited website</strong>: Google Search, I am always looking up information on all sorts of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1\"><strong>Most-have gadget</strong>: My Samsung Galaxy Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1\"><strong>Most-read book</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-Book-Anniversary/dp/1529034523/ref=asc_df_1529034523/?tag=googleshopdsk-22&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=341774347828&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=11336984859330211358&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1000286&amp;hvtargid=pla-900824921450&amp;psc=1&amp;mcid=7a62a8e4207138b6aa43234ba47e3749\">The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</a>, by Douglas Adams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"line-height:1\"><strong>Go-to podcast</strong>: Believe it or not, I don&#8217;t listen to podcasts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out more about Ricky&#8217;s appearance at WordCamp Asia 2024¬†<a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/ricky-blacker/\">here.</a> </p>\n",

In today‚Äôs post, we chat with <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/nada-elsharkawy/\">Nada ElSharkawy</a>, the ¬†Senior Manager, Marketing for GoDaddy and an expert restaurant recommender. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a Senior Marketing Manager at GoDaddy and part of the Commercial Success Team. I&#8217;ll be joining the event from Dubai, which has been my home for the past 2 years. I&#8217;ve lived in 3 countries and speak three-and-a-half  languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My day to day is very simple, as I work from home, I always have my morning coffee with 2 dates then prepare breakfast and check my emails, I head to the gym and train for around an hour, then head home roll my sleeves and start working! I have a few meetings during the day and work a lot with data‚Äîanalyzing and strategizing! I try to cook a healthy dinner and have some quality time with my husband at the end of the day, or go on a walk if the weather is nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been speaking at events for the past 5 years, and when I attended WC Asia 2023 I listened to great talks but noticed that there were no Arab females present on stage. This year, I wanted to represent all the amazing Arab females in tech and in the WordPress world and share my experience and expertise with the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll be sharing my experience with meetups, but I&#8217;ve also been inspired by the community and will be sharing some of their highs and lows in my talk. I hope that my talk inspires more and more people to start and attend meetups around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?¬†</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I am looking forward to the night markets (and of course Boba tea!)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q.

In today‚Äôs post, we chat with <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/aaron-d-campbell/\" data-type=\"wcb_speaker\" data-id=\"5506\">Aaron D. Campbell</a>, Director of Product at <a href=\"https://www.a2hosting.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A2 Hosting</a> about his experiences with WordCamp Asia, his party trick, and his love of high performance UTVs. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I live in Seminole, Oklahoma, a small town of ~7000 people that I often say is &#8220;the middle of nowhere in the middle of the United States&#8221;, although we&#8217;re actually about 540km from the true middle. My day to day as Director of Product at A2 Hosting consists mostly of setting the direction and vision for our products, enabling my team to create amazing product plans, and shepherding those through the process from vision to reality. Personally, my day to day varies a lot with the weather. Right now while it&#8217;s cold, I catch up on my reading and enjoy the peace that comes from staying inside. When the weather is beautiful, I try to get out as often as I can &#8211; maybe for a walk, but especially to the local off-road track when I can. When it&#8217;s incredibly hot, I spend every second I can inside a pool (missing that hot weather at the moment!). </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first WordCamp Asia</a> was an absolute delight, and I knew immediately that I wanted to return. People that shared their experiences, learnings, struggles, and epiphanies with me along my path through life, and specifically in my career, helped me get to where I am today. Any chance I have to share my own experiences back to help others, is almost like me making a payment on that debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Your reputation is absolutely key to achieving your goals. It&#8217;s more than your portfolio or your resume, it can be built both in and out of work, and it&#8217;s always yours no matter where you move to or who you work for. It&#8217;s worth taking the time to start building it purposefully so you can use it effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>My brother-in-law told me that I absolutely have to eat at the top of the Taipei 101 building, so I think that&#8217;s tops on my list right now. In general, I love experiencing new places through food&#8230;so I&#8217;m ABSOLUTELY open to any and all recommendations!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Tell us something about yourself that we might not know. Party tricks? Secret hobbies?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As an introvert, I think my biggest party trick is surviving the party. My not-so-secret, but probably less known, hobby is going fast in or on anything with a motor. In the past I have been heavily into motorcycles, especially of the off-road variety, and now I find myself mostly enjoying high performance UTVs. It&#8217;s something I do with my son, who&#8217;s now 20, and we get quite competitive! </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Lightning Round!¬†</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Most-visited website:</strong> google &#8211; I&#8217;m an information addict and it&#8217;s still my primary portal to finding that info! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Must-have gadget:</strong> My phone &#8211; I use it for everything </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most-read book:</strong> I prefer fiction &#8211; especially fantasy.

In today‚Äôs post, we chat with Pascal Birchler from <a href=\"https://about.google/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://about.google/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google</a> and a long-time WordPress contributor. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a long-time WordPress community member and contributor based in Zurich, Switzerland. Over the years I have done a lot of things around WordPress, be it organizing and speaking at events, developing popular plugins, or building new features in core itself. Today, I am part of a team at Google that is passionate about making the web and especially CMSes like WordPress faster. So my day-to-day involves mostly contributions to the core performance team. This goes from analyzing latest trends to identifying and fixing bugs to writing tools and documentation for developers so they are well-equipped for building performant solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I have fond memories of the few times I have been to events in the APAC region, for example <a href=\"https://tokyo.wordcamp.org/2023/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordCamp Tokyo</a>, which was a blast. People are super friendly and eager to learn about all things WordPress. Originally I wanted to attend already in 2023 (and in 2020 before it was cancelled) but couldn&#8217;t make it. So this time I am extra excited to attend. And because there&#8217;s so many exciting things going on in WordPress that I want to share with people, I figured WordCamp Asia was the best opportunity to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In my talk I will share the latest and greatest around performance in WordPress and what it means to try to make good performance accessible for everyone. Things are moving fast, so I hope to be able to share some cool demos and facts about upcoming developments in this space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m generally eager to meet old and new friends alike and get to know a new city and culture. Haven&#8217;t done any planning so far but I&#8217;m open to suggestions!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Tell us something about yourself that we might not know. Party tricks? Secret hobbies?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Tough one! No party tricks I&#8217;m afraid. A recent new hobby is running. I suppose I took my interest in performance &#8220;offline&#8221; as I started running more regularly and even finished my first half marathon in 2023!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q.

Just like our previous speaker announcements, we are excited to share the impressive credentials and insights that Joseph brings to our event.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About Joseph Jacks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph Jacks is the Founder and General Partner of <a href=\"https://oss.capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OSS Capital</a>, a prominent venture capital firm based in San Francisco. Joseph&#8217;s career has been a remarkable journey through the world of open-source technology, and his contributions have left an indelible mark on the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before founding OSS Capital, Joseph served as an Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) at <a href=\"https://www.quantum.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Quantum Corporation</a>, where he played a pivotal role in supporting the <a href=\"https://github.com/rook/rook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rook</a> project. His efforts led to the project&#8217;s subsequent donation to the <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a>, marking the organization&#8217;s first foray into storage projects. Joseph&#8217;s involvement with CNCF has been extensive, spanning board membership, committee participation, and advisory roles since its inception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph is also known for founding <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/kubecon-cloudnativecon-events/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">KubeCon</a>, an event that is now managed by the Linux Foundation&#8217;s CNCF. Additionally, he founded and built Kismatic, the first enterprise-focused commercial <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kubernetes</a> company, which was eventually acquired by Apprenda and subsequently by ATOS. Throughout his career, Joseph has worked with other notable companies, including Mesosphere (now D2IQ), Enstratius (acquired by Dell Software), TIBCO Software, and Talend, where he held various roles in sales, engineering, product, and strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Joseph is the visionary behind <a href=\"https://opencoresummit.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Open Core Summit</a>, a global conference focused on the Commercial Open-Source Software (COSS) ecosystem. Open Core Summit operates as a vendor-neutral community, featuring leading investment firms, cloud providers, COSS companies, analysts, Fortune 2000 enterprises, and more. The inaugural OCS in 2019 brought together nearly 1,000 attendees from 29 countries, featured 40 major sponsors, and hosted over 100 speakers. The second annual OCS in 2020, held entirely online, drew an astonishing 13,000+ attendees, featured 200+ speakers, and was supported by 50+ major sponsors. These events have played a pivotal role in democratizing knowledge about the rapid growth of the COSS category.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Session Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Get ready for a session by Joseph Jacks titled &#8220;Open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world,&#8221; this talk will unveil the OSS Capital thesis, revealing why open source is the most pivotal trend in technology. Brace yourselves for a journey through the implications this phenomenon holds for crypto, AI, and traditional software and tech businesses, as Joseph navigates the dynamic landscape of open source innovation. Don&#8217;t miss this opportunity to gain profound insights into the tech revolution that&#8217;s changing the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay Tuned for more information</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We will be delivering more information about our speaker lineup, session details, and full depth of the schedule.

In today‚Äôs post, we chat with <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/perth-woratana-ngarmtrakulchol/\">Perth Ngarmtrakulchol</a>, an analytics Engineer at Canva and co-founder of the WordPress community in Thailand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi! My name is Perth. I&#8217;m a data analytics engineer at Canva, juggling Python and SQL to unravel data mysteries. I am currently based on sunny Sydney, Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to give back to the WordPress community that has given me so much. WordPress has provided me with a lot of opportunities in the past. I made a lot of friends from organising WordPress meetups in Bangkok for several years, WordCamp Bangkok events, and WordCamp Asia 2023 in Thailand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>My talk will unveil how WordPress development skills can create multiple income streams. Trust me, WordPress is cooler than you think! I&#8217;ll share real-life experiences and tips on leveraging WordPress for main and side hustles, based on true story in my past 10+ years I used WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s a fun fact: these skills once scored me a free trip to Las Vegas!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This talk will be a good entertainment for developers or anyone who might want to become WordPress developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to reconnect with old pals and make new ones in the WordPress community! And I can&#8217;t wait to soak up knowledge from other speakers. Another goal for me to do in Taiwan is snapping a photo with the towering Taipei 101!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Tell us something about yourself that we might not know. Party tricks? Secret hobbies?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though my name is Perth, I hadn&#8217;t been to the city of Perth until 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q.

Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m coming from the most beautiful city in the world, Novi Sad, Serbia. It will be a ~20 hour trip. My days are never the same because I get bored easily, but every day consists some kind of training (ice skating, running, functional training, walking), coding, writing documentation, singing in a choir (and sometimes conducting it), reading books and great food.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The more I talk about WP-CLI the more I hear from people what are their pain points in using it, which helps me shape my next talk. My motivation is to show people that everyone can use WP-CLI (democratizing terminal) and improve their everyday work with it. Also, I like to travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I never know. My talks are live coding and demoing various things. It&#8217;s always different and can depend on audience questions during or before the talk. But I always have at least one candy that is my personal highlight of the talk. People usually pick something else as their highlight!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people I know from WordPress Slack, but don&#8217;t have a chance to see very often (or at all). I&#8217;m looking forward to see my fellows documentarians and everyone, really.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Tell us something about yourself that we might not know. Party tricks? Secret hobbies?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Coding was my hobby while I was classical musician. Now music is my hobby. I sing in a choir and, when needed, jump in as a conductor. I love ice skating and do it as much as possible during limited months in the season. I also enjoy in taking care of my plants and reading books.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q.

My WordPress journey started in 2016 when I started my 2 blogs; one on Travel and another on Food. Later on, I joined the WordPress Kolkata Community in 2019 and started contributing in the domain of content and photos. On any given Contributor Day, I would like to work on how to effectively do blogging using WordPress. Also the types of Blogs and how to decide on what to write, the Anatomy of Blog posts, what to write and Content Marketing strategy, and how to use social media more inclusively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I like about WordPress as a development tool is its infinitely configurable stature for supporting my purposes. That‚Äôs the joy of working in WordPress. So, for anyone living online, WP is the best platform for publishing and managing content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joy of creating content on WordPress has helped me to connect to the global WordPress communities. Off-late I‚Äôve started attending different WordCamps outside India and thereby constantly in touch with many more amazing WordPressians from different parts of Asia, Europe, and America. I have already been selected as a Speaker in different WordCamps including <strong>WordCamp Asia 2023</strong> and for the first time, chosen as one of the Organizers for <strong>WordCamp Nepal in January 2024</strong>. To add to this glory, on behalf of my Kolkata Community, I‚Äôll be leading one of the GenNext Pilot Projects called <strong>Kolkata CareerCamp</strong> in December 2023.

My journey took an exciting turn when I transitioned myself into a Gutenberg developer, focusing on the future of WordPress content creation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From different forums, blogs, and Facebook groups, I learned about WordPress contributions and I entered the world of open-source contribution, which began just a month ago. In this relatively short period, I&#8217;ve achieved some remarkable milestones that push me to move forward and contribute more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my remarkable contributions is contributing on the&nbsp; &#8220;Twenty Twenty Four&#8221; block theme, a project that I&#8217;m incredibly proud to be a part of. This achievement has not only boosted my confidence but also solidified my commitment to the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, I&#8217;ve been fortunate to receive recognition in the form of seven batches of appreciation for my contributions, which serve as a constant source of motivation to push my boundaries and contribute even more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This contribution journey truly fulfills the invaluable learning experience I gain from collaborating with expert developers in the WordPress ecosystem. Their mentorship and insights continue to shape me into a better developer, and I eagerly anticipate the growth that lies ahead as I continue to contribute to this vibrant community.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" style=\"margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50)\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-20 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Towhidul-Islam.jpeg?resize=500%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7585\" style=\"object-fit:cover;width:133px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Towhidul-Islam.jpeg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Towhidul-Islam.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Towhidul-Islam.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-19 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Towhidul Islam</strong></strong></strong></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0\"><em>Org Username: <strong>towhidulislam123</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0\"><em>Country: <strong>Bangladesh</strong></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You might wonder why I dived into WordPress translation. It‚Äôs simple ‚Äì I‚Äôm a firm believer in the magic of local marketing. Just like how you get that warm feeling when your favorite football club posts in multiple languages, I believe websites should speak the language of their audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a polymath isn‚Äôt just about knowing stuff; it‚Äôs about getting into people‚Äôs shoes (not cleats). Picture this: when they can‚Äôt find support in their own language, it‚Äôs like sending someone to play soccer with a rugby ball &#8211; it‚Äôs just not going to end well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hey, speaking different languages can be fun too. It‚Äôs like being a language ninja, stealthily bridging the communication gap. It‚Äôs not every day you get to be a translator-superhero. So, I thought, why not give it a shot and contribute to WordPress translation? After all, in the world of websites, we need to keep the ball rolling, or should I say, the website scrolling, in every language imaginable. So, here I am, contributing to WordPress translation, one word at a time, because every language matters in this vast digital world.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" style=\"margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50)\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-22 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"501\" height=\"501\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Zunaid-Amin.png?resize=501%2C501&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7586\" style=\"object-fit:cover;width:133px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Zunaid-Amin.png?w=501&amp;ssl=1 501w, https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Zunaid-Amin.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Zunaid-Amin.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-21 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Zunaid Amin</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0\"><em>Org Username: <strong>zunaid321</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0\"><em>Country: <strong>Bangladesh</strong></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wanted to leave a digital signature behind me within the open-source ecosystem, I was thankfully able to contribute to WordPress Core to help make it better.

It&#8217;s been a whirlwind of learning and growth, and I feel truly honored to have the opportunity to give back to the WordPress community, which has given me so much in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My involvement with WordPress has been a journey filled with passion and dedication. The WordPress platform has become more than just a tool; it&#8217;s a vibrant and dynamic community that fosters creativity and collaboration. Being a part of this community has been a tremendous privilege and an incredibly rewarding experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this short time, my contribution to the WordPress ecosystem has been a remarkable learning curve. From diving into the intricacies of code to engaging with fellow contributors, I&#8217;ve expanded my skill set and knowledge in ways I couldn&#8217;t have imagined when I began this journey. The support and encouragement I&#8217;ve received from the WordPress community have been invaluable in propelling me forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am excited beyond words to share that I&#8217;ve received the incredible opportunity to attend WordCamp Asia 2024, sponsored by Rocket.net. This is a dream come true for me, and I am eagerly looking forward to this event. I am profoundly grateful to Rocket.net for their generosity and support, which will undoubtedly enhance my contribution to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" style=\"margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50)\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-24 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Mayank-Kumar.png?resize=500%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7587\" style=\"object-fit:cover;width:133px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Mayank-Kumar.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Mayank-Kumar.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Mayank-Kumar.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-23 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Mayank Kumar</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0\"><em>Org Username: <strong>markmemayank</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0\"><em>Country: <strong>India</strong></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to design websites by using Webnode and Wix when I was in class 8th. In November of 2019, when I was just 16 years old, I learned about WordPress, and I moved from all other platforms to WordPress, which completely changed my life. I was always a tech-lover, so WordPress was something for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, I embarked on an exciting journey into WordCamps. My WordCamp journey began when I attended WordCamp Nagpur 2022 as a Media Partner. This event marked the starting point of my involvement with the vibrant WordPress community. In the same year, I volunteered at WordCamp Kolkata 2022. The experience was exhilarating, allowing me to connect with fellow enthusiasts and seasoned professionals in the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I decided to take things further by attending my first meetup in Delhi NCR. As 2023 rolled around, I was determined to make my mark in the WordPress community. I organised my first meetup in Delhi NCR. That was a huge, successful Meetup and my first step toward success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, on the 20th anniversary of WordPress, I joined the team of WordPress Delhi NCR Community. As the year progressed, I continued to expand my involvement within the community. In July 2023, I joined the Photo Mod Team, further enhancing my role as a contributor to the WordPress Photo Directory project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, in a thrilling turn of events, I was honoured to be a speaker at WordCamp Bengaluru 2023. Sharing my knowledge and insights with an eager audience was a testament to how far I had come in my WordPress journey. To top it all off, I took on the role of Photos Team Lead at WordCamp Bhopal 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I am running two successful ed-tech startups, JNVST Prep (100K+ visitors per month) and CSHUB (30K+ visitors per month), and obviously, these both are up and running with WordPress only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From attending WordCamps and meetups to becoming an organiser, speaker, media partner, volunteer, and team lead, my journey through the WordPress community has been an incredible adventure. With each milestone, I have grown as a WordPress enthusiast, and I look forward to many more years of contributing to this dynamic and ever-evolving ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" style=\"margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50)\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-26 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Kinjal-Dalwadi.jpeg?resize=500%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7588\" style=\"object-fit:cover;width:133px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Kinjal-Dalwadi.jpeg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Kinjal-Dalwadi.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/asia.wordcamp.org/2024/files/2024/01/Kinjal-Dalwadi.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-25 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Kinjal Dalwadi</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0\"><em>Org Username: <strong>kinjaldalwadi</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-right:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-left:0\"><em>Country: <strong>India</strong></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I am an active member of the Ahmedabad WordPress community in India.

My first contribution was to the Plugins channel, providing an awesome experience as I watched installations and activated plugins grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The encouragement from seeing those numbers led me to deepen my involvement in the community, earning badges on my wp.org profile. I expanded my contributions to Polyglots and Core channels, enjoying the structured process with its rules and flaws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the privilege of attending national and international WordCamps, where I participated as a speaker and volunteered. For me, togetherness is not just a destination; it&#8217;s the ongoing journey of contributing and rising together. Let&#8217;s continue to contribute and thrive together.</p>\n",

In today‚Äôs post, we chat with <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/robert-li/\">Robert Li</a>, APAC Automator in Chief &amp; currently Principal Solutions Engineer for WP Engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Firstly, welcome to the lineup! We‚Äôre so glad to have you here. Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself? Where will you be joining the event from, and what does your day-to-day look like?</strong><strong></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I come from Brisbane, Australia. Honestly, I have a pretty regimented day. Typically it starts at around 5am, where I normally go for a run before anything. Then I&#8217;ll either commute or work from home 2-3 days a week. I go to the gym after work 6 days a week and then I&#8217;m promptly to bed at 9-10pm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work day typically consists of morning meetings with my US colleagues before a morning stand-up with my team locally. Throughout the day think of my responsibilities in 3 buckets:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>BAU‚ÄîThis is crunching reports to help our sales team with their customer accounts, doing health checks and providing architectural or optimization recommendations</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal Projects‚ÄîThis is working on tasks in support of our platform and engineering teams, whether that&#8217;s helping with tooling, product management, or fact-finding the better understand our customers</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Special Projects‚ÄîThese are personal projects that I will be working on ad-hoc, case in point, the upcoming presentation for WordCamp Asia 2024!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. We‚Äôre lucky to be welcoming a diverse range of speakers to our program in 2024. What interested you to apply to WordCamp Asia as a speaker? </strong><strong></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Asia is the premier regional WordCamp in our region, so I am honoured to be selected to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan is also a particularly special place for myself and my partner. My partner was born and raised in Fuzhou which is literally only a couple hundred kilometers away from Taipei and so she and I have a great affinity with the food and culture here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are particularly big fans of fried taro balls from the Ningxia night market. That&#8217;s why I applied to speak at WordCamp. So I could eat fried taro balls at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What can audiences expect to learn from your talk/s? Are there any advance sneak peeks or knowledge bombs you can offer us?</strong><strong></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>My talk will give a high level overview of generative AI and LLMs, as well as how I believe the capabilities of these LLMs will be eventually integrated with WordPress, content editorial workflows and development practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, probably most interesting to attendees is, I&#8217;ll also be giving a brief demo of an end to end proof of concept from exporting data from your WordPress site to creating a retrieval augmented generative chatbot or form fill where you can query that data using a large language model with an accompanying Colab Notebook so attendees can follow along after.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. What are you most looking forward to at WordCamp Asia 2024? Is there someone you‚Äôre looking forward to rubbing shoulder with, or a local delicacy you‚Äôd like to sample?&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I love meeting all the different people at WordCamp, some of the brightest thinkers and biggest influences on the ecosystem. I love learning about upcoming developments and I love fried taro balls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q. Tell us something about yourself that we might not know. Party tricks? Secret hobbies?</strong><strong></strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re going to see this in the presentation but&#8230; I&#8217;m an avid baker. I have a 200 year old sourdough starter and apparently my sourdough loaf is pretty good.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q.

In each eVisa application, you can indicate that it should be considered as part of a group application and use the same group name for all of them.</p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>If there are restrictions to stay in Airbnb, or service apartments, then what is the purpose of Gold card, how we can stay for a long time (3 years) in hotels?</summary>\n<p>The Gold Card is an employment visa that allows you to reside in Taiwan based on the duration of your Gold Card (1/2/3 years). If you are planning to stay in Taiwan for an extended period, you may prefer renting a house or apartment instead of staying in expensive hotels or using third-party booking platforms. </p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>All type of hotel and airlines are accepted? Or any recommendation?</summary>\n<p>There are no restrictions on which hotels or airlines to choose when applying for visas. However, please exercise caution when booking through third-party platforms, as some listings may not be legal.</p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>If I&#8217;m going to apply for eVisa via WordCamp Asia, do I still need to download visa letter?</summary>\n<p>No, you do not need to download visa letter. We will issue visa letter for you with detailed flight information and accommodation.</p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>Where is the eVisa application form link to apply via WordCamp Asia?</summary>\n<p>You will find eVisa application link in your ticket confirmation email. If you purchased tickets in first 3 batches, please email us at aisa-local@wordcamp.org.</p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>In the eVisa application Google form that was sent via email, I do not see option to upload ticket email pdf, will you guys fetch it with email and name?</summary>\n<p>Yes, we will look up your ticket information on the official website and cross-check your details.</p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>For eVisa do we need to verify documents from notary or from ROC embassy?</summary>\n<p>No, document verification is not required when applying through WordCamp Asia. However, if MOFA requests document verification after we submit your application, please follow their guidelines.</p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>For the eVisa application, should I upload the bio page of my new passport or is the old one also required?</summary>\n<p>We only accept current passports, so please ensure that your passport has a validity of at least 6 months.</p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>Do I have to write my full name on the event ticket? I don‚Äôt want to show my full legal name on the badge.</summary>\n<p>It is necessary to include your full name on the event ticket, including your middle name. This requirement is in place because the visa letter is valid only when it is attached to the event ticket. Please ensure that your name on the ticket, visa letter, and passport all match. If you prefer not to display your full name on the badge, you can utilize the &#8216;Name on the badge&#8217; field in the ticket. You can then select &#8216;What information you want printed on the Event Badge QR&#8217; to display only the information you choose.</p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>Me and my husband got the WordCamp ticket, so we can apply for eVisa via Flexible Mechanism Process, but how can I get the visa for my 4 years old daughter?</summary>\n<p>Children can also apply for eVisa. Please ensure that when submitting each application, you apply as a group. Children under 12 do not need to purchase a ticket. Additionally, please fill in your children&#8217;s school name in the &#8220;Company/Institution/Organization&#8221; field.</p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>We had Gold Card Webinar Last week, do we need a visa in addition to Gold Card or this is only for those who can&#8217;t apply for Gold Card.</summary>\n<p>Please note that there is no conflict in applying for a Gold Card and a visa at the same time. The Gold Card itself grants unlimited visa entries, so if you are approved for a Gold Card, you do not need to apply for another visa.</p>\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\"><summary>I hold a Chinese passport. Which visa should I apply for?</summary>\n<p>You will need to apply for a business visa for attending the conference.

Is that the correct way?</summary>\n<p>If you are not eligible for the ROC Travel Authorization Certificate, you still have two options: the Visitor Visa for Attending Conference and MOFA&#8217;s eVisa Program Flexible Mechanism. Each option has different requirements and processes, so it&#8217;s important to choose the one that best suits your travel plans and circumstances. You can find a comparison table for these two options on the <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/visa/\">visa page here</a>.</p>\n</details>\n",
