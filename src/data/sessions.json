This talk aims to transform the way we approach this challenge, not just as a technical hurdle, but as an opportunity to elevate the entire coding process. In this session, we delve into the core principle that most bugs are born from unchecked assumptions. By identifying and questioning these assumptions, we can implement a proactive strategy to prevent bugs before they occur. This talk will guide attendees through effective methodologies to critically analyze their code, fostering a deeper understanding of how assumptions can lead to errors and how to mitigate them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will explore several key areas: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Psychology of Assumptions in Coding: Understanding how easy it is to make assumptions and how they can lead to bugs. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Practical Techniques for Assumption-Proofing Your Code: Implementing strategies such as rigorous type-checking, automated testing, and peer code reviews to safeguard against bugs. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Real-World Examples: Analyzing case studies where assumption-led bugs caused major issues and how they were resolved. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transforming Coding Philosophy: Shifting from a reactive to a proactive mindset in coding, emphasizing prevention overcorrection. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Attendees will leave with not just an understanding of common pitfalls in coding but also armed with practical tools and strategies to enhance their coding practices. This talk is ideal for developers, team leads, and anyone passionate about elevating the quality of software development through mindful and strategic coding practices.</li>\n</ul>\n",

This new direction brought with it new challenges, and demanded I learn the ins-and-outs of the startup business model. We&#8217;ll dive into the dynamic landscape of startup life within the WordPress space. After being acquired by Elementor, I had to learn to transition from being a founder and CEO for seventeen years to being an employee. This brought its own challenges, and demanded that I adjust while learning a lot about myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Central to this narrative is the unparalleled experience of being an active participant in the WordPress community. I&#8217;ll share the demands it places on time and resources but, more importantly, how it gives back in so many meaningful ways. The WordPress community has been a transformative force, exposing me to diverse perspectives, introducing me to individuals beyond my immediate circles, and immersing me in rich and varied cultures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working in the WordPress space has been a unique experience—one where the lines between work and passion blur.

This, in turn, will create a virtuous cycle of growth for the WordPress community and enterprise WordPress as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><ul class=\"wordcamp-block wordcamp-post-list has-layout-list wordcamp-speakers\"><li class=\"wordcamp-post-list__post wordcamp-clearfix\">\n<div class=\"wordcamp-speaker wordcamp-speakers__post slug-petya-raykovska\">\n\t<h3 class=\"wordcamp-block__item-title wordcamp-speakers__title\"><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/petya-raykovska/\">Petya Raykovska</a></h3>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wordcamp-image__avatar-container align-center\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/petya-raykovska/\" class=\"wordcamp-image__avatar-link\">\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b5223ebc4690c47d881722e5adb3a177?s=150&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" alt=\"Avatar of Petya Raykovska\" />\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wordcamp-block__item-content wordcamp-speakers__content is-excerpt\"><p>Human Made</p>\n</div>\t\n\t</div>\n\n</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><ul class=\"wordcamp-block wordcamp-post-list has-layout-list wordcamp-speakers\"><li class=\"wordcamp-post-list__post wordcamp-clearfix\">\n<div class=\"wordcamp-speaker wordcamp-speakers__post slug-kimberley-cole\">\n\t<h3 class=\"wordcamp-block__item-title wordcamp-speakers__title\"><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/kimberley-cole/\">Kimberley Cole</a></h3>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wordcamp-image__avatar-container align-center\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/kimberley-cole/\" class=\"wordcamp-image__avatar-link\">\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e9180925773f2e2a49f9fc9406859d9d?s=150&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" alt=\"Avatar of Kimberley Cole\" />\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wordcamp-block__item-content wordcamp-speakers__content is-excerpt\"><p>Yoast / Newfold Digital</p>\n</div>\t\n\t</div>\n\n</li></ul></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><ul class=\"wordcamp-block wordcamp-post-list has-layout-list wordcamp-speakers\"><li class=\"wordcamp-post-list__post wordcamp-clearfix\">\n<div class=\"wordcamp-speaker wordcamp-speakers__post slug-rahul-bansal\">\n\t<h3 class=\"wordcamp-block__item-title wordcamp-speakers__title\"><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/rahul-bansal/\">Rahul Bansal</a></h3>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wordcamp-image__avatar-container align-center\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/rahul-bansal/\" class=\"wordcamp-image__avatar-link\">\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a9253565cd7a0a613c1147db0e66e6f0?s=150&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" alt=\"Avatar of Rahul Bansal\" />\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wordcamp-block__item-content wordcamp-speakers__content is-excerpt\"><p>rtCamp</p>\n</div>\t\n\t</div>\n\n</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><ul class=\"wordcamp-block wordcamp-post-list has-layout-list wordcamp-speakers\"><li class=\"wordcamp-post-list__post wordcamp-clearfix\">\n<div class=\"wordcamp-speaker wordcamp-speakers__post slug-lorna-lim\">\n\t<h3 class=\"wordcamp-block__item-title wordcamp-speakers__title\"><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/lorna-lim/\">Lorna Lim</a></h3>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wordcamp-image__avatar-container align-center\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speaker/lorna-lim/\" class=\"wordcamp-image__avatar-link\">\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/899f6ca2356c26a57acd711545d84776?s=150&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g\" alt=\"Avatar of Lorna Lim\" />\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wordcamp-block__item-content wordcamp-speakers__content is-excerpt\"><p>Human Made</p>\n</div>\t\n\t</div>\n\n</li></ul></div>\n</div>\n",

At its heart, this talk aims to communicate a powerful message: Being acquired is not an epilogue but a transformative chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why is this topic crucial for our community?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reframing Perspectives: The WordPress community thrives on independence. By sharing an insider’s perspective on acquisitions, we aim to foster understanding, showcasing that acquisitions can be strategic alliances rather than dissolutions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choice &amp; Alignment: We’ll delve into the meticulous process of choosing the right fit &#8211; aligning with a company that resonates with your core values, and in our experience, values aspects such as women leadership.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integration Challenges: Merging two companies isn’t just about combining assets. It’s the melding of cultures, ways of working, and sometimes, redefining visions. This talk delves deep into these nuanced aspects, highlighting strategies and learnings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this presentation unique? Our speaker is the last (wo)man standing from the old board of her company. This is not a hypothetical analysis or an outsider’s perspective. It’s a raw, genuine account from someone at the heart of such a transition. With a rich leadership experience both inside and outside the WordPress domain, she offers a multi-faceted viewpoint, resonating with professionals at all stages of their careers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 45 minutes, attendees won’t just get a talk; they’ll experience a journey. A journey that transforms the narrative around acquisitions, equipping professionals with insights to navigate such milestones, should they ever face them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t just another talk. It’s a conversation the WordPress community needs.</p>\n",

Such demands have prompted significant changes in how the web operates, including the imminent deprecation of Third-Party Cookies (3PC).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With major web browsers phasing out support for third-party cookies, businesses, developers, and marketers face the need to reimagine their strategies. In this talk, I will delve into the impact of the impending 3PC deprecation for the and explore practical strategies for preparing and adapting to this transformative shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The talk will consist of two parts. The first part will have four brief sections. (1) We will begin with a brief overview of Cookies as a State Management mechanism, understanding the properties of cookies which makes them vulnerable to misuse, and understanding what exactly will change when 3P Cookies are deprecated; (2) we will then discuss how existing and new Web Platform capabilities can be used to refactor implementation that rely on 3P cookies today; (3) next we will review the tools and resources available to help developers navigate the transition to a web platform without 3P cookies; (4) we will give the audience a scripted approach they can follow to prepare and get ready for the deprecation of 3P cookies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of the talk will explore the importance of embracing privacy-centric technologies which offer a privacy-first approach to ad targeting and measurement, allowing businesses to reach their target audiences without sacrificing user privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The countdown to the 3PC deprecation has already begun, and it is essential to be proactive in our approach.
